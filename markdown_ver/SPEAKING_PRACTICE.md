Part 1 – Introduction & Interview (4–5 minutes)

1. Do you enjoy traveling? Why or why not?

Yes, I love traveling because it can enhance my curiosity about the world and also gives me a sense of happiness. Additionally, I am eager to travel either alone or with my colleagues, as each option brings a different kind of experience. For example, last time I had a chance to go to Ha Giang with my teammates by motorcycle, we went through innumberable/countless experiences. Some pleasant, some challenging - In the end, those moments stuck in my memory as truly joyful and unforgettable.


2. How often do you travel?

It really depends on my free time. Since I am working a full-time job as a software engineer. Most of my free time is on weekends. I usually take short whirlwind trips of one of two days to places near HCM city, such as Tri An lake or Da Lat. I do that every two or three months with my colleagues, though not very regularly. For longer distances, like Lung Cu or Ha Giang or somewher else located in the north side of Vietnam, I need to arrange more days off, so I usually manage that about once a year. I wish I could travel more often because I really love expanding my experience through traveling.

3. What kind of places do you usually like to visit?

To be honest, it really depends on my mood. I prefer being alone in a quiet. secluded place, away from all the bustle and hustle, just to recharge energy after hard days'work. But other times, I love being in lively, crowded places with my friends and my family, because it can give me opportunities to socialize and strengthen my relationships. I think both options have their own value, so I try to balance between the two to make my life meaningful.

4. Do you prefer traveling alone or with others?

Honestly, both option have their own benefits. Traveling alone give you more independence. For example, you can go anywhere you want without asking for suggestions. Or you can try some local foods that you are really curious about. The downside, through, is that it can be more expensive. On the other hand, traveling with others gives you more options and helps you save money, but you have to compromise, because the decisions are made as a group. Personally, I prefer traveling alone when I can afford it, but if I want to save my money and still have some fun, going with friends definitely worth it;.

Have you ever been to a place that surprised you?
