**2. Main**

**Paragraph 1: Đồng ý**: cuộc sống có quá nhiều công việc rất là không tốt, còn cuộc sống không có công việc gì thì rất là vui vẻ

**Version 1:** On the one hand, there are some major drawbacks when a person chooses a life with too much work obligations to fulfill. When work becomes over-concentrated part of a person's life, they would not have enough time for other sacrosanct activities and aspects of their lives. For instance, their time spent with family members or friends is limited, while their own passions and desires cannot be fulfilled. As a result, it would break the work-life balance, causing mental illnesses, physical exhaustion, or even other medical problems.

**Version 2:** On the one hand, there are some major drawbacks when a person choose a life with too much work obligations to fulfill. Although work is highly important, there are other essential areas that a human must fulfill in order to achieve genuine happiness. When they focus excessively on working, the amount of time that they can allocate for pursuing their personal passion, connecting with their friends, or bonding with family members would become insufficient. This imbalance would result in mental pressure and physical exhaustion, leading to illnesses and taking away people's chance to lead meaningful life.

**Paragraph 2: Không đồng ý**: Tại sao một cuộc sống không cần phải làm gì có thể beneficial và có ý nghĩa

On the other hand, being removed from the responsibility of working can give people a chance to acquire more skills and discover the world around them. One of the contributors to people's emotional well-being is the ability to improve themselves by acquiring new knowledge and becoming a better version of themselves. By using the time that is supposed to spend on working, people can pursue academic passions or directly learn about the cultural and societal values of regions around the world.
