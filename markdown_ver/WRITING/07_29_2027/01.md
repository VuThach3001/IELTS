When work becomes an over-concentrated part of a person's life, they would not have enough time for other important activities and aspects of their lives.

As a result, it would break the work-life balance, causing mental illinesses, physical exhaustion, or even other medical problems.

Although work is highly important, there are other essential areas that human must fulfill in order to achieve genuine happiness. When they focus excessively on working, the amount of time that they can allocate for pursuing their personal passion, connecting with friends, or bonding with family members would become insufficient. This imbalance would result in mental pressure and physical exhaustion, leading to illnesses and taking away people's chance to lead a meaningful life.

On the other hand, being removed from the responsibility of working can give people a chance to acquire more skills and discover the world around them. One of the contributors to people's emotional well-being is the ability to improve themselves by acquiring new knowledge and becoming a better version of themselves.
