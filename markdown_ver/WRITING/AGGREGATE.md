**Today, in many countries, both women and men work full-time. Logically, women and men should share household tasks equally.**

**To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

**Thach:**

In this day and age, in many nations where men and women work full-time, some people claim that it is logical for both genders to share household tasks equally. Personally, I strongly agree with this suggestion based on some reasons that are explained in this essay.

In the past, men were generally regarded as the primary earners for their families and therefore did not have enough time left for domestic tasks. As a result, women commonly had to take on most household duties and often suffered from burnout. Today, because both partners in many families work full-time, they both have similar amounts of their free time, enabling more equal contributions to household chores between them and mitigating the negative consequences that many women previously experienced.

Additionally, when men and women are able to share domestic tasks together, their emotional bonds can become strengthened as cooperation leads to understanding and empathy. Also, household chores often include caring for young children in the family, and if both partners can be cooperative, it would foster a better upbringing for the young members since they have equal time to spend with each partner.

In conclusion, regardless of gender, people are often working full-time at the moment. I believe that sharing household tasks equally is highly beneficial and should be done in each family unit. Not only can this arrangement help women to avoid mental and physical fatigue, but it can also promote better connections between all members, including those between parents and between parents and children.

**Polished version:**

In this day and age, in many nations where men and women work full‑time, some people claim that it is logical for both genders to share household tasks equally. Personally, I fully agree with this suggestion for the reasons explained below.

In the past, men were generally regarded as the primary earners and therefore had little time for domestic tasks. As a result, women commonly assumed most household duties and frequently suffered burnout. Today, because both partners in many families work full‑time, they have similar amounts of free time, enabling more equal contributions to household chores and mitigating the negative consequences many women previously experienced. Practical measures such as agreed **rotas**, flexible working hours and shared parental leave make this equitable division realistic.

When partners share domestic tasks, their emotional bonds are strengthened because cooperation fosters understanding and mutual respect. Household chores also include childcare responsibilities; for example, sharing duties such as school drop‑offs, meal preparation and evening routines allows both parents to spend meaningful time with their children. This balanced involvement supports children’s development and reduces the pressure placed on any single caregiver.

In conclusion, as large numbers of people now participate in full‑time employment, I believe that equal sharing of household tasks is both feasible and desirable. Not only can this arrangement help women avoid chronic mental and physical fatigue, but it can also improve family wellbeing by promoting fairness, reducing stress and strengthening relationships between parents and children. For these reasons, families and employers should adopt and support practices that enable partners to share domestic responsibilities more equitably.

**In today's world, private companies rather than the government pay for and conduct most scientific research.**

**Do you think the advantages outweigh disadvantages?**

In this day and age, investing and conducting most scientific research have been executed more frequently by private companies, while the involvement of the government is limited. In this essay, I would evaluate both the pros and cons of this tendency before proposing whether or not the positive aspects overperform its drawbacks.

On the one hand, there are some major benefits when private companies invest in scientific research. First and foremost, the results of study can be a major contributor to the sustainable development of a company. For instance, by investing money in researching, companies can create new products that help satisfy a unmet need in their markets, helping them yield significant resources that fuel their future operation. Furthermore, the sophistication of each research means that handling it using only money from the government is not feasible, making the contribution of private companies is necessary and essential.

On the other hand, the lack of participation of the government in scientific research can damage the ability to uncover new knowledge. Since private companies are under a compulsory obligation to only execute tasks that profit their shareholders, investing in science without resulting in profit is unacceptable for them. As a result, many aspects of science would be overlooked and undermined if their results can potentially damage the profit of private companies. This is why the government must use its resources to fund necessary areas of science such as healthcare and general knowledge, which helps our society's progress without depending on a very small number of wealthy conglomerates.

In conclusion, after considering both sides of the development, I believe the advantages of private‑sector involvement in scientific research outweigh the disadvantages, provided the government continues to fund basic research and enforces appropriate safeguards. Private investment accelerates innovation and brings discoveries to market, while public funding and regulation are necessary to support long‑term, non‑commercial inquiry and to protect the public interest. A complementary model—private firms driving application‑oriented work and governments sustaining foundational science—offers the most balanced and beneficial outcome.

**Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and work of arts by using a computer**

**Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?**

**1. Opening:** Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

Some individuals suggest that because of the ability of computer to demonstrate the historical objects or art pieces, we no longer need public museums and art galleries. Personally, I agree/disagree with this suggestion based on some reasons that are explained in this essay.

**2. Main**

**Paragraph 1:** Giải thích tại sao computers không thể thay thế được arts

It is true that understanding the value of historical or artistic objects requires the comprehension of many aspects, such as texture, the dimension, and the colors of them. Although computers can provide images and descriptions of these objects, they cannot directly provide a tangible connection between observers and the exhibited objects. As a result, computers fall to completely replace art galleries.

**Paragraph 2:** Giải thích tại sao computers không thể thay thế được public museums.

Public museums generally do not display historical objects in isolation. In fact, they often try to provide a comprehensive
