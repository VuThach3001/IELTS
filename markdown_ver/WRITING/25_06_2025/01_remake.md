**Some people think that the increasing business and cultural contact between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result.**

**Discuss both views and give your opinion**

**1. Opening:** Viết lại đề và trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

Some individuals claim that the increasing frequency of cultural and business interactions between nations brings about many benefits, while others think that losing the national identity can be a problem associated with this development. Although both views hold merit, I agree more with the former perspective.

**2. Main**

**Paragraph 1:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại kêu là tương tác business và văn hóa giữa các quốc gia là tích cực.
- Tương tác business:
  - Phát triển kinh tế chung
  - Trao đổi hàng hóa
  - Tăng thu nhập
  - Tăng việc làm

**Mùi huề vốn:** When countries have business activities with other nations, their economy can develop. Furthermore, more jobs can be created, so people can work and make money. Moreover, nations can trade products, so people would have more products to buy.

**Phải định nghĩa trước khi vô bài làm:**
- Business giữa các quốc gia là làm gì?
  - Mở chi nhánh
  - Nhập khẩu hàng hóa
  - Mở khu công nghiệp chung


**Business:**

**Version 1:** when countries work together, they can open shared industrial locations, which can help participated nations share their technological foundations together and create better products.

**Version 2:** As countries have business interactions more frequently, developing nations can welcome companies from developed ones, which have superior technology. As a result, the technological foundation of the developing nations can be improved.

**Version 3:** As business interactions between nations becomes more pronounced, they frequently import products from the international region, helping the domestic consumers to experience a wider range of selections.

**Văn hóa:**

- Tương tác văn hóa là sao?
  - Trang phục
  - Thực phẩm
  - Truyền thống
  - Lễ hội

**Should not do:** when nations interact culturally, they can share their culture together, so people would understand culture better.
- Huề vốn, không cụ thể

As people interact culturally across the border thanks to the globalization that helps movement become easier, domestic individuals can get exposed to new cultural values related to cuisine, custom, and apparel.

**Viết lại khổ 1 hoàn chỉnh:**

One the one hand, there are some benefits when nations interact more with each other in terms of business and culture. First and foremost, as businesses are frequently conducted across the border, it is common for domestic people to be able to work in technologically advanced firms from developed nations or purchase international and high quality products, which can elevate their conditions of living and satisfaction in their lives. Futhermore, as cultural values are exchanged through having more movements from one nation to another, domestic people can get exposed to new knowledge about cuisine, custom, and apparel, helping enrich themselves and foster tolerance and understanding.

**Paragraph 2:** Nhiều quá sẽ mất đi national identities -> chứng minh tại sao lại như vậy.

On the other hand, losing national identities can be a prevalent disadvantage of nations' cultural and commercial interactions. When international trading becomes more common, many domestic products may be overshadowed by internationally imported ones, leading to the elimination of culturally significant goods. Also, as cultural significance is a product of isolation of people in a long period of time, frequent interactions in the morden world would dilute the uniqueness significantly, especially when cultural is commercialized to attract tourists.

**3. Closing**

In conclusion, although there are mixed opinions in determining whether business and cultural contact between nations is beneficial, I believe that they have both benefits and problems. While these interactions can bring about economic benefits, they can dilute cultural uniqueness and eventually erode the significance of a culture.
