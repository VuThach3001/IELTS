**Main**

[Nói ra những vấn đề mà cần đến suggestion này] -> [Dẫn chứng problems bằng ví dụ] -> [Nếu mình dùng suggestion này thì giải quyết được gì?]

**Paragraph 1:** Chứng minh tại sao nên miễn phí giáo dục đại học

**Version 1:** On the one hand, **there are some persuasive rationales that support the claim that university education should be free of charge.** In this day and age, due to stagnant inflation, the cost of education has increased significantly, causing problems for individuals to make a university entry if they come from disadvantagous socioeconomic backgrounds. This would result in their inability to contribute to the workforce, making the country fail to develop effectively. If university education can be given to students for free, many talented individuals can contribute to the workforce, boosting economic development and transforming the quality of living of the whole population.

**Version 2:** On the one hand, there are some persuasive rationales that support the claimn that university education should be free of charge. Nowadays, the cost of education has increased significantly due to the higher demand for quality, teaching facilities, and human resources, effectively prohibiting students with lower means of living from entering universities. This issue leads to the inability of talented individuals to contribute to their nation's workforce, slowing down economic development. If university education is given for free, such a problem would not occur, helping the nations develop better thanks to an improved workforce.

[Nói ra những vấn đề mà không thể dùng suggestion này] -> [Dẫn chứng problems bằng ví dụ] -> [Nếu mình dùng suggestion này thì sẽ gây ra hậu quả gì từ những vấn đề được nêu? / Claim luôn là không thể thực hiện được].

**Paragraph 2 - Không đồng ý**

**Version 1:** On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of making university education free of charge, its actual application could bring about many obstacles and problems. The coverage of such an expenditure means that the government is required to handle an increasing amount of tuition fee and a large number of students. Also, some nations, especially developing ones, many not have a flexible budget that can be spent on such a large expense. As a result, if the proposal of removing the financial obligations for students is implemented, many governments would not manage to complete such task.

**Version 2:** On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of making university education free of charge, its actual application could bring about many obstacles and problems. Given the very large number of university students in a nation and the increasing cost of education at this stage, covering the entire tuition fee for students would require massive amounts of financial resources. Unfortunately, many nations, especially the developing ones, many not have a budget that is large enough for such coverage. As a result, the proposed measure may not be implemented successfully.

[Tóm tắt lại đề] -> [Đưa ra solution hiệu quả nhất cho cái suggestion này]

**Closing** - Tóm tắt lại vấn đề

In conclusion, **although there are mixed opinions on determining whether** the cost of university education should be taken on by all students, I think that the governments still need to provide financial aid on a case-by-case basis. While students with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds should receive support, ones who can pay still need to follow through with their financial obligations to ensure the function of the university.

**2. Some people indicate that apartments are the best type of housing, while others argue that private houses in the street are better.**

**Discuss both views and give your own opinion.**

**Opening**: Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

**Thach:** Some individuals claim that owning apartments is more optimal rather than having personal accommodations with a facade, while others oppose this statement. Although both views hold merit, I agree more with former/latter perspective based on some reasons that are explained in this essay.

**Huy Forum:** Some individuals are of the opinion that the optimal type of accommodation is apartments. In contrast, others think residing in a private house on the street is a superior option. Although both schools of thought offer merit, I agree more with the view that the final decision should be made based on the actual needs of each household.

**Main**

[Nói ra những vấn đề mà cần đến suggestion này] -> [Dẫn chứng problems bằng ví dụ] -> [Nếu mình dùng suggestion này thì giải quyết được gì?]

**Paragraph 1 - viết về view 1:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại nghĩ nhà chung cư là loại nhà ok nhất.

On the one hand, **there are some major rationales that explain why some people think that apartments have the potential to be the best accommodation type.** On the same area of land, the construction of apartments would generally yield a large number of housing units compared to what can be achieved if privates are built. Also, the shared facibilities and amenities would reduce the demand for travel, further cuttign down the cost of living. Thus the affordability makes apartments suitable to people with lower means of living, which generally makes up the largest parts of our polulation.

**Paragraph 2 - viết về view 2:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại nghĩ nhà mặt đất lại oke hơn.

On the other hand, opponents of the previous view claim that private houses on the street are a better form of accommodation. The close proximity with other people, which is common in apartment complex, may disrupt the persoanl living space. For houses on the street, such an issue could be mitigated better due to better insulation from the outside environment. Also, the values of private houses on the street has been proven to increase better compared to apartments, making them a worthy form of investment that yields more value in the future.

**Closing**

In conclusion, **although there are mixed opinions on determining the best forms of accommodation**,  I believe that the ultimate decision needs to be made according to the demand and financial conditions of each household. If a family values privacy and has an interest in investment, a private house on the street is a superior option. In contrast, the lower cost of living associated with apartments is inevitably the best option for people with lower levels of income.

**3. Nowadays, some nations tax sugar more heavily to help citizens eat healthily.**

**Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?**

**Opening**

**Thach:** In this day and age, in order to navigate the dwellers to a healthy and hygiene dietary regimen, a number of countries impose more tax on sugar in a severe way. In this essay, I would examine the benefits and drawbacks of this development before proposing which side is more prominent.

**Huy Forum:** In this day and age, taxing sugar more heavily to make people's diets healthier has become an approach that some nations have adopted. In this essay, I would evaluate both the pros and cons before proposing whether or not the positive aspect overperform its drawbacks.

**Main**

[Nói ra những vấn đề liên quan đến **chủ thể (ở đây là sugar)**] -> [Nêu ra những hậu quả mà nó mang lại, cho ví dụ cụ thể] -> [Vì vậy, đưa ra solution để khác phục tình trạng này] -> [Đưa ra benefits]

**Paragraph 1:** Tích cực

On the one hand, there are some benefits associated with imposing a higher tax level on sugar to improve the diets of citizens. As sugar is highly affordable and can enhance the taste of many dishes, it is virtually present in many parts of our diets, causing excessive accumulation of fats that lead to healthy problems, ranging from obesity to cardiovascular diseases. If the price of sugar is made more expensive, its consumption may plunge, helping people eat better and avoid health issues. This would relieve a lot of burden on each citizen and the whole healthcare system. 

**Paragraph 2:** Tiêu cực

**Option 1:** Đi trực tiếp -> nói là cái measure này sẽ dẫn đến problem gì

**Option 2:** Vẫn thừa nhận nó hiệu quả, nhưng việc áp dụng nó sẽ không thực tế hoặc khó khăn **(recommend)**

On the other hand, this measure would have some problematic implications that should receive more attention. Sugar has been an important part of our diets for many centuries as it exists in various forms and in many types of food, which ultimately gives us energy to function. When the price of sugar increases, many food that has moderate amounts of it would have the price surged according, casuing problems for people's accessibility to food and prompting backlashs from general consumers.

**Closing**

In conclusion, after assessing both the positive and negative implication of the measure that imposes higher tax on sugare to improve people's diets, I think that the benefits outweigh the negative aspects. As many food producers over-ultilize sugar and are directly responsible for causing more health problems for consumers, sugar has long been a part of our diets. As a result, imposing higher tax should only be applied for food that has unacceptable sugar content.

**4. In this era, technology has replaced a lot of humans at work.**

**Why? What are the solution?**

**Opening:** Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

**Thach:** In this day and age, many occupations have been replaced by technological advancements, increasing the unemployment rate. In this essay, I would explain the reasons behind this tendency before proposing what should be done to effectively remedy this.

**Huy Forum:** In this day and age, many occupations have been replaced by technological advancements, increasing the unemployment rate. In this essay, I would explain the reasons leading to this tendency before proposing some effective solutions.

**Main**

There are some major reasons that explain why technology has replaced many humans at work. First and foremost, machines have the ability to function continuously without the need of break time, which is an inevitable requirement for human workers. Second, technological advancements have equipped machines ưith the ability to make decisions, moderate their actions, and improve the accuracy level to a point that con not be matched by humans. Thus, many jobs have been replaced, and the tendency does not show any sign of stopping.

Despite the severity of this development, governmental intervention along with raising the awareness of each individual could effectively mitigate it. There should be a regulation from the government to better protect the benefits of employees, especially ones that are prone to be replaced by technology. The government should require a specific number of human workers at a factory site, acting a supervisor of machinery works. Also, each citizen must equip themselves with sufficient knowledge to better adapt to changes brought about by technology, which could help them find jobs in novel job markets, such as computer science or machinery design.

In conclusion, many people are losing their jobs due to the higher level of efficiency and effectiveness that technological advancements have brought about. However, the government can still mitigate this by issuing new regulations to protect workers' benefits and provide morje education for people to find employment opportunities in novel job markets.

**1. Opening:** Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

**Thach:** In this day and age, normal hierachial structure have been eliminated in a large number of companies and more dynamic one is being used as the replacement. In this essay, I would evaluate the reasons behind this tendency before providing what influences it can cause on communities.

**Huy Forum:** In this day and age, the conventional model of work that emphasizes specific roles and the establishment of structure has become less popular, and many firms start using a more disorder structure. In this essay, I would explain the underlying reasons leading to this development before assessing its overall implications on workers, the companies, and soceity as a whole.

**2. Main**

**Paragraph 1: Why?**

**Cấu trúc hierachy có đặc điểm gì?**
- Sếp, nhân viên - vai trò rõ ràng, phân công trách nhiệm là phải làm theo
- Phù hợp với kỷ nguyên sản xuất (industrial era)

**Cấu trúc flexible có đặc điểm gì?**
- Ai cũng đóng góp ý kiến được hết
- Phù hợp với kỷ nguyên tôn vinh sự sáng tạo, cung cấp dịch vụ tốt nhất cho khách hàng. (technology-driven work environment)

**Xã hội chúng ta (về mặt sản xuất) đã chuyển từ giai đoạn gì sang giai đoạn gì?**
- Từ kỷ nguyên sản xuất sang kỷ nghuyên tôn vinh sự sáng tạo đòi hỏi phải thay đổi structure trong công ty

**Version 1:** There are some reasons that explain waning popularity of the hierachial structure among modern companies. In the past, have a solid work structure provided clear lines of authority and control, which were essential in managing large organizations  effectively, especially in the industrial era. Nowadays, as the largest sector that contributes to many nations' economies has been service-oriented, innovation and creativity are highly valued. By establishing a more flexible structure, companies hope that their employees can be empowered to contribute their ideas, voice their novel suggestions, and give the firms an advantage against other competitors.

**Version 2:** There are some reasons that explain waning popularity of the hierachial structure among modern companies. In the past, our economy revolved around industrial production, which requires a strict adherence to standards and rules. This is why many conpanies chose to establish a rigid work structure, which helped them avoid unexpected errors or problems. However, as our world becomes more servicing-oriented, creative ideas are highly valued than ever before. With a flexible structure, employees are encouraged to be more vocal about their ideas, which can help their firms create innovative solutions and enhance the quality of service.

**TCA technique practices**

**1. People nowadays retire much earlier than the past. Why? Is this a positive or negative development?**

- Why do the people want to retire? Is there any criteria that help them retire?
  - Financial matters
    - Past: Low income, accumulation of money is hard to reach, resulting in the time to take for the retirement is longer.
    - Today: High income

**Version 1:** In the past, our excessive reliance on agriculture that drains people's physical power would not help them yield a higher level of income. This slow process of wealth accumulation led to a very delayed point of time whey they could retire and stop working. Fortunately, as our economy has progressed exponentially, people can save enough financial resources for earlier retirement. Once they reach the point of financial stability, they would stop working and focusing more on enjoying their lives.

**Version 2:** It is estimated that our GDP in 1950s was 80% lower than the current levels, which apply for most countries despite their development status. This limited capabilities to make money explained why people in the past usually did not reach the point of financial stability until very late in their lives. Fortunately, the current income can speed up this process, helping people accumulate enough resources that can facilitate earlier retirement.

**2. Nowadays, people often live longer after their retirement.**

- Why do people live longer compared to the past?
  - Sức khỏe
    - Past: 
      - Dịch vụ không bằng
      - chất lượng đồ ăn kém hơn

**CTA - Characteristic Trait Association**
- Chuyên dùng để giải thích hành vi

**Despite the proven effects of teamwork, many people still want to work alone. Why? Is is positive for people who avoid teamwork?**

- Teamwork - cần phải compromise quan điểm cá nhân, chấp nhận các ý kiến trái chiều. 
- Mà một số người có cái tôi lớn, thiếu kỹ năng giao tiếp -> Dễ xảy ra mâu thuẫn.
  - Teamwork requires the ability to compromise with potential different sets of ideas and beliefs, and each member must maintain a high level of social interactions.
  - Nevertheless, many individuals are introverted, meaning that their ability to socialize with others would have some limits. Also, for ones who are not willing to reconcile with others' opinions, conflicts may occur and bring about detrimental implications.
