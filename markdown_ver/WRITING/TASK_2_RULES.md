[Nói ra những vấn đề mà cần đến suggestion này] -> [Dẫn chứng problems bằng ví dụ] -> [Nếu mình dùng suggestion này thì giải quyết được gì?]

**Paragraph 1:** Chứng minh tại sao nên miễn phí giáo dục đại học

**Version 1:** On the one hand, **there are some persuasive rationales that support the claim that university education should be free of charge.** In this day and age, due to stagnant inflation, the cost of education has increased significantly, causing problems for individuals to make a university entry if they come from disadvantagous socioeconomic backgrounds. This would result in their inability to contribute to the workforce, making the country fail to develop effectively. If university education can be given to students for free, many talented individuals can contribute to the workforce, boosting economic development and transforming the quality of living of the whole population.

**Version 2:** On the one hand, there are some persuasive rationales that support the claimn that university education should be free of charge. Nowadays, the cost of education has increased significantly due to the higher demand for quality, teaching facilities, and human resources, effectively prohibiting students with lower means of living from entering universities. This issue leads to the inability of talented individuals to contribute to their nation's workforce, slowing down economic development. If university education is given for free, such a problem would not occur, helping the nations develop better thanks to an improved workforce.

**Paragraph 2 - Không đồng ý**

**Version 1:** On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of making university education free of charge, its actual application could bring about many obstacles and problems. The coverage of such an expenditure means that the government is required to handle an increasing amount of tuition fee and a large number of students. Also, some nations, especially developing ones, many not have a flexible budget that can be spent on such a large expense. As a result, if the proposal of removing the financial obligations for students is implemented, many governments would not manage to complete such task.

**Version 2:** On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of making university education free of charge, its actual application could bring about many obstacles and problems. Given the very large number of university students in a nation and the increasing cost of education at this stage, covering the entire tuition fee for students would require massive amounts of financial resources. Unfortunately, many nations, especially the developing ones, many not have a budget that is large enough for such coverage. As a result, the proposed measure may not be implemented successfully.

[Tóm tắt lại đề] -> [Đưa ra solution hiệu quả nhất cho cái suggestion này]

**Closing** - Tóm tắt lại vấn đề

In conclusion, **although there are mixed opinions on determining whether** the cost of university education should be taken on by all students, I think that the governments still need to provide financial aid on a case-by-case basis. While students with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds should receive support, ones who can pay still need to follow through with their financial obligations to ensure the function of the university.

**2. Some people indicate that apartments are the best type of housing, while others argue that private houses in the street are better.**

**Discuss both views and give your own opinion.**

**Opening**: Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

**Thach:** Some individuals claim that owning apartments is more optimal rather than having personal accommodations with a facade, while others oppose this statement. Although both views hold merit, I agree more with former/latter perspective based on some reasons that are explained in this essay.

**Huy Forum:** Some individuals are of the opinion that the optimal type of accommodation is apartments. In contrast, others think residing in a private house on the street is a superior option. Although both schools of thought offer merit, I agree more with the view that the final decision should be made based on the actual needs of each household.

**Main**

[Nói ra những vấn đề mà cần đến suggestion này] -> [Dẫn chứng problems bằng ví dụ] -> [Nếu mình dùng suggestion này thì giải quyết được gì?]

**Paragraph 1 - viết về view 1:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại nghĩ nhà chung cư là loại nhà ok nhất.

On the one hand, **there are some major rationales that explain why some people think that apartments have the potential to be the best accommodation type.** On the same area of land, the construction of apartments would generally yield a large number of housing units compared to what can be achieved if privates are built. Also, the shared facibilities and amenities would reduce the demand for travel, further cuttign down the cost of living. Thus the affordability makes apartments suitable to people with lower means of living, which generally makes up the largest parts of our polulation.

**Paragraph 2 - viết về view 2:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại nghĩ nhà mặt đất lại oke hơn.

On the other hand, opponents of the previous view claim that private houses on the street are a better form of accommodation. The close proximity with other people, which is common in apartment complex, may disrupt the persoanl living space. For houses on the street, such an issue could be mitigated better due to better insulation from the outside environment. Also, the values of private houses on the street has been proven to increase better compared to apartments, making them a worthy form of investment that yields more value in the future.

**Closing**

In conclusion, **although there are mixed opinions on determining the best forms of accommodation**,  I believe that the ultimate decision needs to be made according to the demand and financial conditions of each household. If a family values privacy and has an interest in investment, a private house on the street is a superior option. In contrast, the lower cost of living associated with apartments is inevitably the best option for people with lower levels of income.

**3. Nowadays, some nations tax sugar more heavily to help citizens eat healthily.**

**Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?**

**Opening**

**Thach:** In this day and age, in order to navigate the dwellers to a healthy and hygiene dietary regimen, a number of countries impose more tax on sugar in a severe way. In this essay, I would examine the benefits and drawbacks of this development before proposing which side is more prominent.

**Huy Forum:** In this day and age, taxing sugar more heavily to make people's diets healthier has become an approach that some nations have adopted. In this essay, I would evaluate both the pros and cons before proposing whether or not the positive aspect overperform its drawbacks.

**Main**

[Nói ra những vấn đề liên quan đến **chủ thể (ở đây là sugar)**] -> [Nêu ra những hậu quả mà nó mang lại, cho ví dụ cụ thể] -> [Vì vậy, đưa ra solution để khác phục tình trạng này] -> [Đưa ra benefits]

**Paragraph 1:** Tích cực

On the one hand, there are some benefits associated with imposing a higher tax level on sugar to improve the diets of citizens. As sugar is highly affordable and can enhance the taste of many dishes, it is virtually present in many parts of our diets, causing excessive accumulation of fats that lead to healthy problems, ranging from obesity to cardiovascular diseases. If the price of sugar is made more expensive, its consumption may plunge, helping people eat better and avoid health issues. This would relieve a lot of burden on each citizen and the whole healthcare system. 

**Paragraph 2:** Tiêu cực

**Option 1:** Đi trực tiếp -> nói là cái measure này sẽ dẫn đến problem gì

**Option 2:** Vẫn thừa nhận nó hiệu quả, nhưng việc áp dụng nó sẽ không thực tế hoặc khó khăn **(recommend)**

On the other hand, this measure would have some problematic implications that should receive more attention. Sugar has been an important part of our diets for many centuries as it exists in various forms and in many types of food, which ultimately gives us energy to function. When the price of sugar increases, many food that has moderate amounts of it would have the price surged according, casuing problems for people's accessibility to food and prompting backlashs from general consumers.

**Closing**

In conclusion, after assessing both the positive and negative implication of the measure that imposes higher tax on sugare to improve people's diets, I think that the benefits outweigh the negative aspects. As many food producers over-ultilize sugar and are directly responsible for causing more health problems for consumers, sugar has long been a part of our diets. As a result, imposing higher tax should only be applied for food that has unacceptable sugar content.

**4. In this era, technology has replaced a lot of humans at work.**

**Why? What are the solution?**

**Opening:** Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

**Thach:** In this day and age, many occupations have been replaced by technological advancements, increasing the unemployment rate. In this essay, I would explain the reasons behind this tendency before proposing what should be done to effectively remedy this.

**Huy Forum:** In this day and age, many occupations have been replaced by technological advancements, increasing the unemployment rate. In this essay, I would explain the reasons leading to this tendency before proposing some effective solutions.

**Main**

There are some major reasons that explain why technology has replaced many humans at work. First and foremost, machines have the ability to function continuously without the need of break time, which is an inevitable requirement for human workers. Second, technological advancements have equipped machines ưith the ability to make decisions, moderate their actions, and improve the accuracy level to a point that con not be matched by humans. Thus, many jobs have been replaced, and the tendency does not show any sign of stopping.

Despite the severity of this development, governmental intervention along with raising the awareness of each individual could effectively mitigate it. There should be a regulation from the government to better protect the benefits of employees, especially ones that are prone to be replaced by technology. The government should require a specific number of human workers at a factory site, acting a supervisor of machinery works. Also, each citizen must equip themselves with sufficient knowledge to better adapt to changes brought about by technology, which could help them find jobs in novel job markets, such as computer science or machinery design.

In conclusion, many people are losing their jobs due to the higher level of efficiency and effectiveness that technological advancements have brought about. However, the government can still mitigate this by issuing new regulations to protect workers' benefits and provide morje education for people to find employment opportunities in novel job markets.
