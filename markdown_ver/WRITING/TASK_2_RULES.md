**Paragraph 1:** Chứng minh tại sao nên miễn phí giáo dục đại học

**Version 1:** On the one hand, **there are some persuasive rationales that support the claim that university education should be free of charge.** In this day and age, due to stagnant inflation, the cost of education has increased significantly, causing problems for individuals to make a university entry if they come from disadvantagous socioeconomic backgrounds. This would result in their inability to contribute to the workforce, making the country fail to develop effectively. If university education can be given to students for free, many talented individuals can contribute to the workforce, boosting economic development and transforming the quality of living of the whole population.

**Version 2:** On the one hand, there are some persuasive rationales that support the claimn that university education should be free of charge. Nowadays, the cost of education has increased significantly due to the higher demand for quality, teaching facilities, and human resources, effectively prohibiting students with lower means of living from entering universities. This issue leads to the inability of talented individuals to contribute to their nation's workforce, slowing down economic development. If university education is given for free, such a problem would not occur, helping the nations develop better thanks to an improved workforce.

**Paragraph 2 - Không đồng ý**

**Version 1:** On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of making university education free of charge, its actual application could bring about many obstacles and problems. The coverage of such an expenditure means that the government is required to handle an increasing amount of tuition fee and a large number of students. Also, some nations, especially developing ones, many not have a flexible budget that can be spent on such a large expense. As a result, if the proposal of removing the financial obligations for students is implemented, many governments would not manage to complete such task.

**Version 2:** On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of making university education free of charge, its actual application could bring about many obstacles and problems. Given the very large number of university students in a nation and the increasing cost of education at this stage, covering the entire tuition fee for students would require massive amounts of financial resources. Unfortunately, many nations, especially the developing ones, many not have a budget that is large enough for such coverage. As a result, the proposed measure may not be implemented successfully.

[Tóm tắt lại đề] -> [Đưa ra solution hiệu quả nhất cho cái suggestion này]

**Closing** - Tóm tắt lại vấn đề

In conclusion, **although there are mixed opinions on determining whether** the cost of university education should be taken on by all students, I think that the governments still need to provide financial aid on a case-by-case basis. While students with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds should receive support, ones who can pay still need to follow through with their financial obligations to ensure the function of the university.

**2. Some people indicate that apartments are the best type of housing, while others argue that private houses in the street are better.**

**Discuss both views and give your own opinion.**

**Opening**: Viết lại đề sau đó trả lời câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

**Thach:** Some individuals claim that owning apartments is more optimal rather than having personal accommodations with a facade, while others oppose this statement. Although both views hold merit, I would evaluate the persuasiveness of each school of though before proposing my personal opinion.

**Huy Forum:** Some individuals are of the opinion that the optimal type of accommodation is apartments. In contrast, others think residing in a private house on the street is a superior option. Although both schools of thought offer merit, I agree more with the view that the final decision should be made based on the actual needs of each household.

**Paragraph 1 - viết về view 1:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại nghĩ nhà chung cư là loại nhà ok nhất.

On the one hand, **there are some major rationales that explain why some people think that apartments have the potential to be the best accommodation type.** On the same area of land, the construction of apartments would generally yield a large number of housing units compared to what can be achieved if privates are built. Also, the shared facibilities and amenities would reduce the demand for travel, further cuttign down the cost of living. Thus the affordability makes apartments suitable to people with lower means of living, which generally makes up the largest parts of our polulation.

**Paragraph 2 - viết về view 2:** Giải thích tại sao người ta lại nghĩ nhà mặt đất lại oke hơn.

On the other hand, opponents of the previous view claim that private houses on the street are a better form of accommodation. The close proximity with other people, which is common in apartment complex, may disrupt the persoanl living space. For houses on the street, such an issue could be mitigated better due to better insulation from the outside environment. Also, the values of private houses on the street has been proven to increase better compared to apartments, making them a worthy form of investment that yields more value in the future.

**Closing**

In conclusion, **although there are mixed opinions on determining the best forms of accommodation**,  I believe that the ultimate decision needs to be made according to the demand and financial conditions of each household. If a family values privacy and has an interest in investment, a private house on the street is a superior option. In contrast, the lower cost of living associated with apartments is inevitably the best option for people with lower levels of income.
