**Paragraph 1:**

**Version 1:** In the first step, a digger extracts clay from the ground. The extracted clay is then sifted on a metal grid before falling on a roller. The sifted clay is then mixed with sand and water before being shaped into bricks using either a wire cutter or a mould.

**Version 2:** The first step begins with the extraction of clay from the ground using a digger. This extracted clay is then sifted to ensure consistency as a metal grid breaks down clumps in the clay. The sifted clay is then conveyed on a roller before being mixed with sand and water and taken on shape of brick using either a mould or a wire cutter.

**Paragraph 2:**

**Version 1:** These freshly shaped bricks are then dried in a drying oven from one to two days.
