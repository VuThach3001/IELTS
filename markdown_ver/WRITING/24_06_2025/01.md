**1. Opening**: Viết lại đề, sau đó trả lời 2 câu hỏi 1 cách ngắn gọn

In a large number of professional environments, the role of creativity and imagination has become increasingly essential, while technical expertise has been overlooked more. In this essay, I would evaluate the reasons behind this development before proposing whether it is beneficial or detrimental.

**Why is this the case?**

**Version 1:** In the past, production relied heavily on humans as workers must manually help machines run or guide them closely to avoid errors. However, with the development of technology, many repetitive tasks related to technical functions can be performed by machines, undermining the demand for technical expertise. In contrast, as technology has not yet replaced humans in creating and innovating, these values have been more emphasized by many workplaces.

**Version 2:** In the past era of industrialization, technical knowledge was highly valued as workers must spervise machine functions or personally execute technical tasks. However, thanks to the emergence of artificial intelligence and automation, these repetitive tasks, such as production and manufacturing, have been done completely by machines. However, as machines cannot replace humans' intellectual capabilities, creativity and imagination are still highly needed and valued.
