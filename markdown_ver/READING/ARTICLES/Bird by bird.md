**Grammar:**

- **Verb + towards + noun phrase**: MOVEMENT

- **Verb + towards + gerund (-ing form)** : PURPOSE
  - The company is moving towards reducing costs.

- **Noun + towards + noun/gerund**: RELATION / PURPOSE
  - His attitude towards women is outdated.
  - Their progress towards achieving their goals is impressive.
  - My efforts towards my goals are valuable.

- **Adjective + towards + noun:** 
  - We use towards with adjectives that describe an attitude, feeling, or behavior directed at someone/something. It emphasizes the **direction of the attitude** rather than just the state.

    - happy with/about (not happy towards)

- They **describe a noun** or appear after a **linking verb**.
  
---

- **Compound adjectives + noun:**
  - A compound adjective always describes a noun (same role as a normal adjective).
  - **Structure:** Compound adjective + noun
  - **Examples:**
    - a life-enhancing book (= a book that enhances life)
    - a well-known actor (= an actor who is well known)
    - a time-saving method (= a method that saves time)

---

- **Compound adjectives + verb (linking verbs):**
  - Adjectives don’t directly attach to verbs. But they can come after a linking verb (be, seem, feel, look, become).
  - **Structure:** Subject + linking verb + compound adjective
  - **Examples:**
    - That experience was life-enhancing.
    - The solution seems time-saving.
    - His attitude is narrow-minded.

- **Compound adjectives formed from verbs:**
  - Sometimes you make a compound adjective starting with a verb in -ing or -ed form, often joined with another word:

  - **Verb-ing based:**
    - mind-blowing (= blows your mind)
    - heart-breaking (= breaks your heart)
    - thought-provoking (= provokes thought)
    - slow-burning (= burns slowly, develops gradually)

  - **Verb-ed based:**
    - open-minded (= mind is open)
    - broken-hearted (= heart is broken)
    - sun-dried (= dried in the sun)

**A Spark A flint: How Fire Leapt To Life**

*The control of fire was the first and perhaps greatest of humanity’s steps [**towards**](#towards) a [**life-enhancing**](#compound-adjectives) technology.*

![alt text](image.png)

**To early man**, the fire was a [**divine**](#divine) gift randomly delivered in the form of lightning, forest fire, or burning [**lava**](#lava). Unable to make flame for themselves, the earliest peoples probably stored fire by keeping [**slow-burning**](#compound-adjectives) [**logs**](#log) [**alight**](#alight) or by carrying [**charcoal**](#charcoal) in [**pots**](#pot).

How and where man learned how to produce flame [**at will**](#at-will) is unknown. It was probably a secondary invention, accidentally made during [**tool-making**](#tool-making) operations with wood or stone. Studies of [**primitive**](#primitive) societies suggest that the earliest method of making fire was through [**friction**](#friction). European [**peasants**](#peasant) would insert a wooden drill in a round hole and rotate it [**briskly**](#briskly) between their [**palms**](#palm). This process could be speeded up by [**wrapping**](#wrapping) a [**cord**](#cord) around the drill and pulling on each end.

The Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays and burning glasses were also used by Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese.

Percussion methods of firefighting date back to Paleolithic times, when some Stone Age tool-makers discovered that chipping flints produced sparks. The technique became more efficient after the discovery of iron, about 5000 years ago In Arctic North America, the Eskimos produced a slow-burning spark by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that contains sulfur. The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. In Europe, the combination of steel, flint, and tinder remained the main method of firefighting until the mid 19th century.

Fire-lighting was revolutionized by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669 by a German alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold. Impressed by the element’s combustibility, several 17th-century chemists used it to manufacture fire-lighting devices, but the results were dangerously inflammable. With phosphorus costing the equivalent of several hundred pounds per ounce, the first matches were expensive.

The quest for a practical match really began after 1781 when a group of French chemists came up with the Phosphoric Candle or Ethereal Match, a sealed glass tube containing a twist of paper tipped with phosphorus. When the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing the phosphorus to self-combust. An even more hazardous device, popular in America, was the Instantaneous LightBox — a bottle filled with sulphuric acid into which splints treated with chemicals were dipped.

The first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by John Walker, an English pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military rocket-maker called Congreve. Costing a shilling a box, Congreves were splints coated with sulphur and tipped with potassium chlorate. To light them, the user drew them quickly through folded glass paper.

Walker never patented his invention, and three years later it was copied by a Samuel Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French chemistry student called Charles Sauria produced the first “strike-anywhere” match by substituting white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the Walker formula. However, since white phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats away jaw-bones. It wasn’t until 1906 that the substance was eventually banned.

That was 62 years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red or amorphous phosphorus, a development exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot J E Lundstrom in 1885. Lundstrom’s safety matches were safe because the red phosphorus was non-toxic; it was painted onto the striking surface instead of the match tip, which contained potassium chlorate with a relatively high ignition temperature of 182 degrees centigrade.

America lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety standards. It wasn’t until 1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a French patent for safety matches — but the formula did not work properly in the different climatic conditions prevailing in America and it was another 11 years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US.

The Americans, however, can claim several “firsts” in match technology and marketing. In 1892 the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches. The innovation didn’t catch on until after 1896 when a brewery had the novel idea of advertising its product in matchbooks. Today book matches are the most widely used type in the US, with 90 percent handed out free by hotels, restaurants, and others.

Other American innovations include an anti-afterglow solution to prevent the match from smouldering after it has been blown out; and the waterproof match, which lights after eight hours in water.
